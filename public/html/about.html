            Hey how's it going? My name's Rigoberto Hernandez III (you can just call me Rigo).

  I'm an alumni from the University of Florida's Telecommunication department and I've spent the last several years with a camera in hand. I first picked up photography as a hobby six years ago, and haven't put it down since. I've been doing professional videography for several months now, and have picked up professional photography this year.

  It's a passion of mine to make your photographic dreams come true. I've done graduation photoshoots, portrait and headshot photoshoots and I'm currently working on expanding my event photography. I prefer taking candid pictures as I feel it captures an authentic moment, and makes for a more genuine image. My favorite locations are in the outdoors, accentuating the lovely nature that's all around us in this beautiful city called Gainesville.
